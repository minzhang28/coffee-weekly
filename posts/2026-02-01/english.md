## How to Choose

If you're into bright, acidic pour overs that taste like juice, grab the Rogue Wave Ethiopia. For a reliable, comforting daily brew, the Revolver blend is your workhorse. On espresso, the Colombian pulls a clean, sweet shot that's great on its own or in a small milk drink. The Ethiopia is a challenge to dial in but rewards you with a floral, tea-like shot for straight espresso drinkers.
